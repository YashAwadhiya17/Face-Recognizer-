# Face-Recognizer-
This project builds a face recognition system using PCA for dimensionality reduction, LDA for feature extraction, and an MLP neural network for classification. It preprocesses images, trains and evaluates the model, and provides predictions with visual results. The system also supports testing on new images for practical applications.
